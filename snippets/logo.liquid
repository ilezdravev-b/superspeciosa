<!-- snippets/logo.liquid -->

{% comment %}
    This is used on multiple layout files and template files, including: 
        - snippets/header.liquid
        - sections/gift-card.liquid

    Dev note: When possible, unless dealing with a large and complex
    logo image (i.e. larger than around 5kb), replace this setup with
    an inline SVG to reduce HTTP requests and improve page load times.

    No matter what, the logo file added should be a SVG file.
